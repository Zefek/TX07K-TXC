sentence=Arduino library for reading TX07K-TXC wireless temperature and humidity sensors.
paragraph=The TX07K-TXC Arduino library enables seamless communication with TX07K and TXC wireless temperature and humidity sensors. It uses hardware interrupts for accurate signal timing, automatically decodes raw RF transmissions into temperature, humidity, channel, and sensor ID, and ensures data integrity with synchronization pattern detection and CRC checks. A flexible callback mechanism allows your code to react instantly to new measurements, including button-triggered updates. Ideal for projects requiring reliable wireless environmental monitoring with minimal setup.
